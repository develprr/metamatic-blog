Metamatic is now a registered trademark. A registered trademark is indicated with ® symbol. 
Find out details [here](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#basic/1+1+1+1/100+100+100+100/metamatic).

## What Does It Mean?

This change means absolutely nothing. Metamatic's purpose is to globally help developers
create better software and refine their ideas. Metamatic continues to be free for use
by any party in the world. Since Metamatic® is based on Apache 2.0 license, you are
free to copy and fork this framework any time.

## Why Was Registration Applied?

The application for Metamatic's registration as a Europe-wide trademark was filled
on Thursday 10th January 2019 between 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning. This act was inspirational
in nature and did not have any rationally explicable motivation other than 
curiosity about trademark registration process in general.

## What's next?

Absolutely nothing. Have a great day, whoever you are!
