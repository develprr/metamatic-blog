title: Redefining the Full Stack Developer

In information technology, terminology has always been a bit slippery,
especially when describing human roles. 

Speaking of software development, it has been customary to classify developers
as many varieties like web developer, backend developer, database developer 
and so on. If you take a person who does all these things, you get a full
stack developer. A person who claims to be a full stack developer
wants to tell you that they know how to develop both user interfaces,
server end points and are also confident with database queries.

## Beyond the full stack

Although the "full stack" might sound like a lot, there has been still some important 
components missing from the definition of that stack.
In particular, think about the process of shaping up IT infrastructures.

To many "home-grown" developers who started out with self-made apps 
and hobby projects and then integrated into startups and then corporations, 
the idea of defining *big* IT infrastructures having
multiple server machines talking to each other over different
protocols and balancing huge amounts of data traffic by splitting 
responsibility over multiple machines and environments  
may have seemed a bit like black magic, some secret art that only
few knew to unfold. 

However, the boundaries may be shifting again.

## Bring in the AWS Cloud Development Kit

The AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is one of the most amazing tools that 
I've come across in a long time. In the old days, setting up an IT
infrastrucure was a big deal, requiring lots of cables, different machines
and configuration scripts in multiple formats and languages. 
But today, the AWS CDK changes all that because with this toolkit, 
you can actually define all that complex infrastructure
using very simple code, one deployment pipeline and just one programming language...
(By the way, I recommend TypeScript!)

## Where to start?

In my previous blog posts, I have sometimes written some real code examples
to highlight my ideas. I won't let you down this time either - but since being a bit lazy 
today, I point you, dear inspired reader, to some good tutorials written by others,
starting from [here](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html).

Cheers!
